# object-detection
Object detection algorithm based on pretrained Yolov4. Originally being created for self supervised robotic learning, but may be used otherwise. Come with a GUI that displays x-coordinate, y-coordinate, the object being detected, and the corresponding confidence level. Run the 'OD_Script.py' to launch the actual application. The rest of the files contain various functions, and data for the Yolov4 Object Detection algorithm. The GUI has been designed via the Tkinter library.
